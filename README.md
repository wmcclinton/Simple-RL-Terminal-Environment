This is a simple Reinforcement Learning Terminal Environment. It is made for 2 agents with turn based movements, but it is meant as only a base it can be extended for multiple agents and other game types.

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo recursively.

You can either include the library in your own Python script

```

Or you can run test.py and watch the magic

Like this:

python test.py
